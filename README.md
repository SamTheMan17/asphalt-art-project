# Unit 1 - Asphalt Art

## Introduction

Cities use asphalt art to improve public safety, inspire their residents and visitors, and brighten communities. Your goal is to create asphalt art to revitalize The Neighborhood and bring the community together with the help of the Painter.

## Requirements

Use your knowledge of object-oriented programming, algorithms, the problem solving process, and decomposition strategies to create asphalt art:
- **Create a new subclass** – Create at least one new subclass of the PainterPlus class that is used for a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Plan an algorithm** – Use the problem solving process and decomposition strategies to plan an algorithm that incorporates a combination of sequencing, selection, and/or iteration.
- **Write a method** – Write at least one method in a PainterPlus subclass that contributes to a component of the asphalt art design.
- **Document your code** – Use comments to explain the purpose of the methods and code segments.

## Notes: Neighborhood & Painter Class

This project was created on Code.org's JavaLab platform using the built in Neightborhood GUI output. To test and edit this project you must build in Code.org's JavaLab with the Neighborhood GUI enabled. For reference to the Painter class documentation, [you can read more here.](https://studio.code.org/docs/ide/javalab/classes/Painter)

## Reflection

1. Describe your project.

My project is a Minecraft-inspired 8 by 8 block pixel art representation of a character’s face using code. I designed and implemented a method to recreate the face of a Minecraft villager by using different colors, such as LightSalmon for the skin, ForestGreen for the eyes, sienna for the hair, and brown for additional facial details. The program moves a virtual painter around the grid, turning and painting lines to match the correct pixel locations, recreating the character’s face with precision.

2. What are two things about your project that you are proud of?

I am proud of how closely my pixel art resembles the Minecraft villager, particularly the use of color choices to accurately capture the distinct features like the green eyes, black unibrow, and sienna-colored nose. Additionally, I’m proud of the way I managed to structure the code, breaking down the drawing into manageable methods for the skin, eyes, and other features, making the project easier to manage and expand upon.

3. Describe something you would improve or do differently if you had an opportunity to change something about your project.

 If I had the chance to improve my project, I would try to optimize the movements of the virtual painter, reducing unnecessary turns or moves. This would make the code more efficient and easier to follow.
